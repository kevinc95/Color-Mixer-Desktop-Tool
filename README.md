# Color Mixing Desktop Tool

The concept of this project was created, and assigned to me by my Introduction to GUI Programming and Graphics professor, Mr. Denis Gracanin, at Virginia Tech.

This Color Mixing Desktop Tool displays a GUI of a color box and three sliders red, green, and blue individually (GUI.png). By changing any values on the sliders, the color box updates to display the resulting color based off the values from the sliders.

# Download and Execution

If you wish to download and execute this application, first download this folder onto your computer. Assuming you have JDK 8 on your computer, go to the ~/CS3744HW1/src/cs3744/hw1 directory on your command prompt and enter this command
> javac *.java

to compile all the java files.
Then return to ~/CS3744HW1/src directory where the cs3744 folder is. To run the program, you then enter this command
> java cs3744.hw1.HW1

The GUI should pop up, allowing you to be able to play around with different colors by changing the slider values.
